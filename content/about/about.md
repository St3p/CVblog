# Stephanie Lizet Zepeda Sanchez

I am a Electromechanic technician student at Fanshawe College and during my diploma, I have developed multiple projects of mechanical design, automation, robotics and mechanical systems, the most interesting ones I have published in this blog. In addition to this I pursued a mechatronics degree in the Tecnologico de Monterrrey, Campus Queretaro.

My goal is to become a professional as complete as possible, with skills beyond the practical application of the knowledge acquired in the career and technical diploma.
If you are interested in knowing more about my projects, do not hesitate to ask.
