## simulation of mechanisms using Solidworks.

This Mechanism is one of the most used systems in the field of mathematics. It's an arrangement of parts designed to make a rotary straight motion movement, these are most commonly found inside of engines. So, we can define it as one type of four bar linkages which has three revolute joints and one sliding joint.

The coordinate system to this type of mechanism should make the x-axis and the slider one coincide, so we can associate a vector with each link also we can say that the magnitude of this vector is the length of the link that is being analyzed, the direction of the vector is along the link, so we can conclude that the system made a loop.
