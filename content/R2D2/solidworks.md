# Frame

This design was made taking into account the multiple vents and panels of the robot as seen in the films, so in the future it could have the space to accommodate little systems for their movement. The measurements took into account to make the frame were taken from the website wwww.astromech.com, and is a 1:2 replication of R2D2.

# Head mechanism

The operation of this mechanism is simple, as it consists of a motor in the center of the head which gives action to an axial gear that moves smoothly thanks to the help of a lazy Susan that is attached to the front and the base of the head.
