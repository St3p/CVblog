      <description>What is a raspberry pi? The Raspberry Pi is a very cheap computer that runs Linux, but it also provides a set of GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins that allow you to control electronic components for physical computing and explore the Internet of Things (IoT).
What Raspberry Pi models have been released? There have been three generations of Raspberry Pis: Pi 1, Pi 2, and Pi 3, and there has generally been a Model A and a Model B of most generations.</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi is a very cheap computer that runs Linux, but it also provides a set of GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins that allow you to control electronic components for physical computing and explore the Internet of Things (IoT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-raspberry-pi-models-have-been-released&#34;&gt;What Raspberry Pi models have been released?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been three generations of Raspberry Pis: Pi 1, Pi 2, and Pi 3, and there has generally been a Model A and a Model B of most generations. Model A is a cheaper variant and tends to have reduced RAM and ports like USB and Ethernet. The Pi Zero is a spinoff of the original (Pi 1) generation, made even smaller and cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-can-you-do-with-a-raspberry-pi&#34;&gt;What can you do with a Raspberry Pi?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people buy a Raspberry Pi to learn to code, and people who can already code use the Pi to learn to code electronics for physical projects. The Raspberry Pi can open opportunities for you to create your own home automation projects, which is popular among people in the open source community because it puts you in control, rather than using a proprietary closed system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>What is cybersecurity? Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.
Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.
Advancements on cybersecurity   Blockchain The digital ledger allows for the secure sharing of information and identity authentication, without the typical risks of exposing data to outsiders.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain
The digital ledger allows for the secure sharing of information and identity authentication, without the typical risks of exposing data to outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud Technology
e diverse array of data that can be stored on a single cloud account is staggering but this also exposes users to obvious security flaws. Fortunately, cloud security has made leaps and bounds in recent years, with developers ensuring that all data is much better protected against hacks than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IoT Security
One of the major flaws with early-release Internet of Things technology is that it connected multiple devices without a common security apparatus.
Nowadays it is common for IoT software to have a cybersecurity infrastructure that can be shared with all devices within a household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <content>&lt;p&gt;An internet based on quantum physics will soon enable inherently secure communication. A team at Delft University of Technology, is building a network connecting four cities in the Netherlands entirely by means of quantum technology. Messages sent over this network will be unhackable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Delft network, will be the first to transmit information between cities using quantum techniques from end to end. The technology relies on a quantum behavior of atomic particles called entanglement. Entangled photons can’t be covertly read without disrupting their content. But entangled particles are difficult to create, and harder still to transmit over long distances. This technology has demonstrated it can send more than 1.5 kilometers, and they are confident they can set up a quantum link between Delft and the Hague by around the end of this year. Ensuring an unbroken connection over greater distances will require quantum repeaters that extend the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such repeaters are currently in design at Delft and elsewhere. The first should be completed in the next five to six years with a global quantum network following by the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Thermal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magnetic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of smart materials has been expanded recently to include any materials that may not display a physical change,  but do hold electronic functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Material scientists and smart materials
Common examples of products that hold intelligent materials include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mood rings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responsive glasses that darken when in direct sunlight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colour-changing mugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these may not be considered particularly groundbreaking, material scientists are continuing their studies to ascertain potential applications of other materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-are-the-problems-with-smart-materials&#34;&gt;What are the problems with smart materials?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the applications of smart materials (both current and futuristic) are far-reaching, some drawbacks are preventing a heavier reliance on them, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delicacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diminished performance over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporation difficulties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toxicity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Future applications of smart materials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;aerial-industry&#34;&gt;Aerial industry&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application of smart materials will enable the wings of aircraft to be more flexible thanks to shape-memory alloys. The outer elements of an aircraft will become more skin-like in that they will have to be strong, hard and rigid, yet flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory behind this design stems from Da Vinci’s flying machine, an example of a historic smart material theory being realised with tomorrow’s modern technology. The ‘skin’ of the plane will also have self-healing properties, even when the aircraft is in flight; thanks to the introduction of self-healing plastics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;energy-sector&#34;&gt;Energy Sector&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation of printed photovoltaic cells will allow the energy sector to take solar panels to the next level. Photovoltaic cells can be painted onto any surface, in any shape. These cells can transform sunlight and heat into electricity. This will undoubtedly have a positive impact on residential properties and, while this solution is not yet commercially-ready, the industry is certainly getting closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mobile-industry&#34;&gt;Mobile industry&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are LG devices that already contain self-healing materials, restoring any scratches that occur on the back of the device. However, research is currently taking place to move this on to another level. The aim is to invent self-healing glass (for screens) and lithium batteries that can be housed within mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;automotive-industry&#34;&gt;Automotive industry&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windscreen chips become cracked due to water molecules within the air mixing with the chip in the glass, breaking it down and worsening the condition. Crack-resistant glass is currently in development that reacts well with airborne water molecules, resulting in the glass healing over time instead of deteriorating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As material scientists continue to study intelligent materials, further future applications will be discovered. The opportunity within the energy, automotive, medical and even military sectors are sure to benefit from the technological advances available through the incorporation of smart materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CNC are manufacturing machines that run on numeric controlled programs to manufacture parts of high precision for the industry. The CNC uses different software&amp;rsquo;s to control all of the machines motions as the spindle speed and the axes movements. This machines uses a special language called “G-Code”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the CNC Machines the manufacture parts were done manually by machinists, they were less precise and took a lot more time than tne CNC the be done. With this machining tools the industry  got an increase in their productivity thanks to the capacity of the mchine to run automatically without the constant attention of an operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;cnc-milling-machines&#34;&gt;CNC Milling Machines&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a mill, the cutter is placed in the spindle where it rotates. The workpiece then moves past the cutter so that chips may be sliced off. The act of cutting a workpiece on a mill is called “Milling”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNC Mills have at the very least the ability to cut in 3 dimensions which are referred to as the X, Y, and Z axes.  Each axis is controlled by a servo or stepper motor that is triggered by the CNC Control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RnIvhlKT7SY?autoplay=1&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;cnc-lathes&#34;&gt;CNC Lathes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some view Lathes as the only universal CNC Machine because a lathe can make all of the parts needed for another lathe. A lathe spins the workpiece in a spindle while a fixed cutting tool approaches the workpiece to slice chips off of it. Because of this geometry, lathes are ideal for parts that have symmetry around some axis that could be chucked up in the spindle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNC Lathes have at the very least the ability to drive the cutting tool under g-code control over 2 axes, referred to as X and Z. They may have a considerable amount of other functionality as well, and there are many variations on lathes such as Swiss Lathes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;cnc-routers&#34;&gt;CNC Routers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CNC Router is actually a type of CNC Mill, typically one that uses what’s called a “gantry” configuration. They’re called CNC Routers instead of CNC Gantry Mills when they’re used to cut wood, but this need not exclusively be the case.  A typical CNC Router is usually not capable of as much precision as a CNC Mill.  They sacrifice some precision in the name of a larger work envelope with the gantry design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many think of CNC machines as being focused on cutting metal, but there is a huge market for CNC woodworking machines of which the CNC Router is the principle example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;cnc-plasma-cutters-lasers-and-waterjets&#34;&gt;CNC Plasma Cutters, Lasers, and Waterjets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNC Plasma Cutters, Lasers, and Waterjets are different kinds of CNC Machines that are used primarily to cut parts out of flat sheet material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;even-more-cnc-machines&#34;&gt;Even More CNC Machines&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of CNC Machines is extensive.  Here are some of the other possibilities we haven’t mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Electronic Discharge Machines (“EDM’s”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Foam Cutters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Wire Bending and Tubing Bending Machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Punches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Embroidery Machines (they put custom logos on Baseball caps!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Pattern Cutters (for cutting vinyl, paper, and more in precise patterns)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Food Makers (for cake decoration and more)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Pottery Printers (a form of 3D Printer)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;cnc-lathes&#34;&gt;CNC Lathes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some view Lathes as the only universal CNC Machine because a lathe can make all of the parts needed for another lathe. A lathe spins the workpiece in a spindle while a fixed cutting tool approaches the workpiece to slice chips off of it. Because of this geometry, lathes are ideal for parts that have symmetry around some axis that could be chucked up in the spindle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNC Lathes have at the very least the ability to drive the cutting tool under g-code control over 2 axes, referred to as X and Z. They may have a considerable amount of other functionality as well, and there are many variations on lathes such as Swiss Lathes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;cnc-routers&#34;&gt;CNC Routers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CNC Router is actually a type of CNC Mill, typically one that uses what’s called a “gantry” configuration. They’re called CNC Routers instead of CNC Gantry Mills when they’re used to cut wood, but this need not exclusively be the case.  A typical CNC Router is usually not capable of as much precision as a CNC Mill.  They sacrifice some precision in the name of a larger work envelope with the gantry design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many think of CNC machines as being focused on cutting metal, but there is a huge market for CNC woodworking machines of which the CNC Router is the principle example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;cnc-plasma-cutters-lasers-and-waterjets&#34;&gt;CNC Plasma Cutters, Lasers, and Waterjets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNC Plasma Cutters, Lasers, and Waterjets are different kinds of CNC Machines that are used primarily to cut parts out of flat sheet material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;even-more-cnc-machines&#34;&gt;Even More CNC Machines&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of CNC Machines is extensive.  Here are some of the other possibilities we haven’t mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Electronic Discharge Machines (“EDM’s”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Foam Cutters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Wire Bending and Tubing Bending Machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Punches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Embroidery Machines (they put custom logos on Baseball caps!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Pattern Cutters (for cutting vinyl, paper, and more in precise patterns)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Food Makers (for cake decoration and more)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Pottery Printers (a form of 3D Printer)&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>One of London&amp;rsquo;s lesser-known monuments is this reminder of the London Soap and Cosmetic Company at Clarence and South streets. The factory, here from 1875 to 1984, burned in April 1985, at which time it was the oldest surviving soap factory in Canada. These machines were taken from the ruins and made into a monument by the Ontario Society for Industrial Archaeology.
The monument is located on South St. next to Richard B.</description>

      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-does-it-work&#34;&gt;how does it work?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a combat between two remote controlled robots until one is incapacitated. This competitions are televised the most famous ones are robot wars in the UK and BattleBots in the US, they were televised for a short period of time in the 1990 and 2000, with a little hype in the 2010. There are smaller robot combat events that are staged for live audiences such as those organized by the Robot Fighting League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robot builders are generally hobbyists and the complexity and cost of their machines can vary substantially. Robot combat uses weight classes, with the heaviest robots able to exert more power and destructive capabilities. The rules of competitions are designed for the safety of the builders, operators, and spectators while also providing for an entertaining spectacle. Robot combat arenas are generally surrounded by a bulletproof screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competitor robots come in a variety of designs, with different strategies for winning fights. Robot designs typically incorporate weapons for attacking opponents, such as axes, hammers, flippers and spinning devices. Rules almost always prohibit gun-like weapons as well as other strategies not conducive to the safety and enjoyment of participants and spectators.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://stepzep.com/img/battleweights.png&#34;  class=&#34;left&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;h1 id=&#34;safety-precautions&#34;&gt;Safety precautions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the violent nature of robot fighting, safety is always the most important issue at robot events. Robot fights take place in a sturdy arena, usually constructed of steel, wood, and bulletproof clear Lexan plastic. The smaller, lighter classes compete in smaller arenas than the heavyweights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition rules set limits on construction features that are too dangerous or which could lead to uninteresting contests. Strict limits are placed on materials and pressures used in pneumatic or hydraulic actuators, and fail-safe systems are required for electronic control circuits. Generally off-limits for use as weapons are nets, liquids, deliberate radio jamming, high-voltage electric discharge, untethered projectiles, and usually fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;robot-fighting-associations&#34;&gt;Robot fighting associations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sport has no overall governing body, though some regional associations oversee several events in managerial or advisory capacities with published rulesets. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robot Fighting League (RFL), primarily U.S., operated 2002—2012
Fighting Robot Association (FRA), U.K., 2003–
Standardised Procedures for the Advancement of Robot Combat (SPARC), U.S., 2015–[10]
The major televised competitions have operated outside of these associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;prohibited-weaponry&#34;&gt;Prohibited weaponry&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the first robot combat competitions, some types of weapons have been prohibited either because they violated the spirit of the competition or they could not be safely used. Prohibited weapons have generally included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radio jamming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High voltage electric discharge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquids (glue, oil, water, corrosives&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire (except in BattleBots)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explosives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Un-tethered projectiles (except in BattleBots from 2018 season onwards)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entanglement devices (except in Robot Wars from series 10 onwards)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lasers above 1 milliwatt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual obstruction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Halon – a specific fire extinguishing gas effective as a weapon in stopping internal combustion engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanoid robot Pepper was created by Japan’s SoftBank Robotics to serve as a type of kiosk at shops, hospitals and airports. It can track eye contact, express emotion and even have simple conversations with people. Eka is a robot arm with seven axes of movement that scoops the ice cream, while Tony pours chocolate on top of the scoop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handle is a mobile manipulation robot designed for logistics. Handle autonomously performs mixed SKU pallet building and depalletizing after initialization and localizing against the pallets. The on-board vision system on Handle tracks the marked pallets for navigation and finds individual boxes for grasping and placing.
When Handle places a boxes onto a pallet, it uses force control to nestle each box up against its neighbors.  The boxes used in the video weigh about 5 Kg (11 lbs), but the robot is designed to handle boxes up to (15 Kg) (33 lb).  This version of Handle works with pallets that are 1.2 m deep and 1.7 m tall (48 inches deep and 68 inches tall).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The theatre opened on September 9, 1901 under the ownership of the theatre magnate, Ambrose Small who reportedly considered this theatre his favourite of his numerous similar holdings. He disappeared mysteriously on December 2, 1919. That day, Mr. Small deposited one million dollars in a Toronto bank account, lunched with his wife and was never seen again. Weeks after his disappearance, the night watchman swore he saw Mr. Small entering The Grand Theatre.</description>

      <description>Frame The design was made taking into account the multiple vents and panels of the robot seen on the films, so in a future it could have space to accommodate little systems for their movement. The measurements took into account to make the frame where taken from the website wwww.astromech.com
Head mechanism The operation of this mechanism is simple it consist on a motor in the center of the head which gives action to a axial gear that moves smoothly thanks to the help of a lazy Susan that is attached to the from and the base of the head.</description>

      <description>simulation of mechanisms using Solidworks. The Mechanism used to recreate the movement is the slider crank. This Mechanism is one of the most used systems in the mathematical field, it is an arrangement of parts designed to make a rotary straight motion movement as the type of movement that makes a piston engine, so me can define it as one type of four bar linkages which has three revolute joints and one sliding joint.</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Mechanism used to recreate the movement is
the slider crank. This Mechanism is one of
the most used systems in the mathematical field,
it is an arrangement of parts designed to make
a rotary straight motion movement as the
type of movement that makes a piston
engine, so me can define it as one type of
four bar linkages which has three revolute
joints and one sliding joint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coordinate system to this type of
mechanism should make the x-axis and the
slider one coincide, so we can associate a
vector with each link also we can say that
the magnitude of this vector is the length of
the link that is being analyzed, the direction
of the vector is along the link, so we can
conclude that the system made a loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;procedure&#34;&gt;Procedure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, the circuit was generated in the Livewire simulator to check that it worked properly, as shown in the following image:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://stepzep.com/img/livewirecircuit.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Circuit&#34;  class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 8px;&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, the circuit was generated on the breadboard according to the previously simulated circuit. Once the correct forward voltages were achieved from each of the regulators experimentally, we were able to generate the circuit for printing with Autodesk&amp;rsquo;s Eagle application, as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having arranged the components and wired them so that they do not touch or stick together, we print the circuit on photographic paper. Having already printed the circuit on the photographic paper, it was placed on the phenolic plate and ironed for approximately 30 minutes so that the impression will remain on the phenolic plate. The circuit was immediately marked on the plate with the black Sharpie down, it was started to put it in the plastic tray with 70% ferric chloride and 30% hot water for approximately 20 minutes so that the copper was eliminated in the parts that did not. they connected. After this time, the plate was cleaned with a little thinner so that the pure copper circuit remained on the plate. The result is shown below after following the aforementioned process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the components were placed in their proper positions according to the simulation that was done in Eagle, the components were soldered and solder was filled in the spaces of the circuit where it was not well reflected to ensure that it would conduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the board with the components and working properly were put in a plastic box with holes for the respective voltage and potentiometer outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slider-cranks are a commonly used type of mechanism translating a rotary movement
into a linear one, or the other way around. In this lab session, three slider-crank variations were
modelled using ADAMS software. Their movements were simulated and analyzed to find the
velocities and position for certain input angles. The obtained results were compared to manual
computations using the vector loop equations. With these two outcomes, it was attempted to
estimate the accuracy of the ADAMS software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main applications of it can be found in the industry as in the engines powered by
diesel or gasoline, also this type of mechanism has been used and analyzed over time for their
advantages as: low cost, few parts, weight and others.
The coordinate system to this type of mechanism should make the x-axis and the slider
one coincide, so we can associate a vector with each link also we can say that the magnitude of
this vector is the length of the link that is being analyzed, the direction of the vector is along the
link, so we can conclude that the system made a loop&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://stepzep.com/img/sliderADAMS.png&#34;  class=&#34;left&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;h1 id=&#34;methodology&#34;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slider-crank mechanism element AB rotates at constant speed 0.26 rad/s (15°/s)
anti-clockwise. Dimensions of elements AB and BC are 120 and 250 mm respectively. To be
determined is the velocity of the slider when the angle between AB and the ground, ϕ, equals
45°.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://stepzep.com/img/sliderFBD.png&#34;  class=&#34;left&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In order to find the velocity of the slider, the mechanism was modelled in ADAMS View.
The two bars had a width and depth of 8 and 1 respectively, and lengths as indicated in the
description. The material of the bars was left unspecified. Rotational joints were applied at
points A, B and C and a translational one between C and the ground. A motion of 15°/s was
applied at point A. The movement of the mechanism was simulated for 20 seconds with 5000
steps. After that, the post processor function was used to analyse the movements. To find the
exact velocity of point C at the desired input angle, first the x value for which ϕ equals 45° had
to be determined by carefully moving over the graph using the arrow keys in the plot tracking
function. Subsequently, this x value was checked in the velocity graph to obtain the velocity of
point C at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://stepzep.com/img/sliderADAMS2.png&#34;  class=&#34;left&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;h1 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;results&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the input angles of 45°, 27,62° and 90° x positions of respectively 1335,80, 1442,52
and 935 were found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

error       0.44027549  -0.0007834  0.0985414
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table 1: different values for the x-position of the slider as obtained through ADAMS compared
to values computed using Matlab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To verify the results, the computations were repeated using Matlab. Subsequently, the
percentage error was determined. Two conclusions can be drawn from this comparison: firstly, it
is evident that the percentage error is rather large, hence the ADAMS software is likely to be
inaccurate. Secondly however, the differences between the percentage errors are remarkably
large as well, which is a strong indicator that human mistakes were made: software might make
mistakes, but will be more or less consistent all the time. Both of these reflections are reasons
not to attach too much value to the results of this project. More research would be needed to
figure out where exactly the errors lie, and how the correct results can be found.&lt;/p&gt;

The coordinate system to this type of mechanism should make the x-axis and the slider
one coincide, so we can associate a vector with each link also we can say that the magnitude of
this vector is the length of the link that is being analyzed, the direction of the vector is along the
link, so we can conclude that the system made a loop&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;methodology&#34;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slider-crank mechanism element AB rotates at constant speed 0.26 rad/s (15°/s)
anti-clockwise. Dimensions of elements AB and BC are 120 and 250 mm respectively. To be
determined is the velocity of the slider when the angle between AB and the ground, ϕ, equals
45°.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://stepzep.com/img/sliderFBD.png&#34;  class=&#34;left&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In order to find the velocity of the slider, the mechanism was modelled in ADAMS View.
The two bars had a width and depth of 8 and 1 respectively, and lengths as indicated in the
description. The material of the bars was left unspecified. Rotational joints were applied at
points A, B and C and a translational one between C and the ground. A motion of 15°/s was
applied at point A. The movement of the mechanism was simulated for 20 seconds with 5000
steps. After that, the post processor function was used to analyse the movements. To find the
exact velocity of point C at the desired input angle, first the x value for which ϕ equals 45° had
to be determined by carefully moving over the graph using the arrow keys in the plot tracking
function. Subsequently, this x value was checked in the velocity graph to obtain the velocity of
point C at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;results&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the input angles of 45°, 27,62° and 90° x positions of respectively 1335,80, 1442,52
and 935 were found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table 1: different values for the x-position of the slider as obtained through ADAMS compared
to values computed using Matlab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To verify the results, the computations were repeated using Matlab. Subsequently, the
percentage error was determined. Two conclusions can be drawn from this comparison: firstly, it
is evident that the percentage error is rather large, hence the ADAMS software is likely to be
inaccurate. Secondly however, the differences between the percentage errors are remarkably
large as well, which is a strong indicator that human mistakes were made: software might make
mistakes, but will be more or less consistent all the time. Both of these reflections are reasons
not to attach too much value to the results of this project. More research would be needed to
figure out where exactly the errors lie, and how the correct results can be found.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>&lt;p&gt;In 1819 the world was going through a transition that nowadays we call the industrial
revolution, the challenge in this era was to make the machines simpler, change most of
the systems for others more simpler and easier, mechanisms for converting rotary into
linear motion were the ones that were investigated the most, and the accuracy of the
system to development was important for the machines that were going to be applied in.
In the middle of all this was James Watt, he developed mechanisms that were
ingenious and simple, like the Watt linkage, in which the central moving point of the linkage
is constrained to travel on an approximation to a straight line. Now a days it is used mainly in
the cars suspension. The most shocking of this idea was that he developed it in a letter to
Mattew Boulton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#Methodology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simulate the mechanism in fig.1 using solidworks and adams and plot the
trajectory of point P, for this we have the following measures for each of the links in
fig. 1:&lt;/p&gt;

L2 150.205    L4 270      B 237.11
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In adams the simplest way to make the mechanism is using markers for
reference, while on solidworks we have to make each of the parts separately and then
unite them in an assembly, for both of them we have make an animation after plotting
the P plot.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Screen Saver: Basic Scroll: The Mouse For the first part, it was decided to use six JK flip flops (74LS76) connecting their outputs to the J inputs and the negated outputs to the K inputs, for the first flip flop a two input OR (74LS32) connected to the output of the last flip flop and to a pulse signal, so that, together with the clock signal connected to all the flip flops, a high signal would be passed through all the flip flops and with the outputs in parallel connect them to the display.</description>

&lt;p&gt;In part two, we used seven D flip flops (74LS74) connecting their outputs to the D inputs, for the first flip flop a voltage signal was connected to the D input and a two input AND (74LS08) connected to the clock input To the clock signal and to a dip switch to be able to pause the circuit, the negated output of the last flip flop was also connected to the reset of the flip flops so that once the sequence was finished it would restart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;screen-saver-sliding-in-two-displays-the-viper&#34;&gt;Screen Saver: Sliding in two displays: The viper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third part was made very similar to the first with twelve JK flip flops (74LS76) with the difference that each parallel output was connected to NOR&amp;rsquo;s of five inputs (74LS260) and three inputs (74LS27), later the outputs of the NOR&amp;rsquo;s were connected to NOT&amp;rsquo;s (74LS04), since each segment of the sequence had to remain on for three and four clock times depending on the sequence.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;screen-saver-the-ball&#34;&gt;Screen Saver: The Ball&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last part, it was also very similar to activity 1, nine JK flip flops (74LS76) were used, where each parallel output was connected to four pins of the displays in such a way that the shape of a ball was generated and follow the sequence requested. In the same way, a dip switch was connected to the resets of all the flip flops in order to stop the sequence and restart it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;screen-saver-the-ball&#34;&gt;Screen Saver: The Ball&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last part, it was also very similar to activity 1, nine JK flip flops (74LS76) were used, where each parallel output was connected to four pins of the displays in such a way that the shape of a ball was generated and follow the sequence requested. In the same way, a dip switch was connected to the resets of all the flip flops in order to stop the sequence and restart it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hi there My name is Radek and I&amp;rsquo;m the author of this theme. I made it to help you present your ideas easier.
We all know how hard is to start something on the web, especially these days. You need to prepare a bunch of stuff, configure them and when that’s done — create the content.
This theme is pretty basic and covers all of the essentials. All you have to do is start typing!</description>

&lt;p&gt;We all know how hard is to start something on the web, especially these days. You need to prepare a bunch of stuff, configure them and when that’s done — create the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theme is pretty basic and covers all of the essentials. All you have to do is start typing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 duotone themes&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on your preferences (orange, red, blue, green, pink)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fira Code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as default monospaced font. It&amp;rsquo;s gorgeous!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;really nice, custom duotone&lt;/strong&gt; syntax highlighting based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://prismjs.com&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PrismJS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mobile friendly layout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there you have it&amp;hellip; enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Stephanie Lizet Zepeda Sanchez I am a Electromechanic technician student at Fanshawe College and during my diploma, I have developed multiple projects of mechanical design, automation, robotics and mechanical systems, the most interesting ones I have published in this blog. In addition to this I pursued a mechatronics degree in the Tecnologico de Monterrrey, Campus Queretaro.
My goal is to become a professional as complete as possible, with skills beyond the practical application of the knowledge acquired in the career and technical diploma.</description>
