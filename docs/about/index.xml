      <description>Stephanie Lizet Zepeda Sanchez I am a Electromechanic technician student at Fanshawe College and during my diploma, I have developed multiple projects of mechanical design, automation, robotics and mechanical systems, the most interesting ones I have published in this blog. In addition to this I pursued a mechatronics degree in the Tecnologico de Monterrrey, Campus Queretaro.
My goal is to become a professional as complete as possible, with skills beyond the practical application of the knowledge acquired in the career and technical diploma.</description>
