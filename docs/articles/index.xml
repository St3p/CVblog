      <description>What is a raspberry pi? The Raspberry Pi is a very cheap computer that runs Linux, but it also provides a set of GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins that allow you to control electronic components for physical computing and explore the Internet of Things (IoT).
What Raspberry Pi models have been released? There have been three generations of Raspberry Pis: Pi 1, Pi 2, and Pi 3, and there has generally been a Model A and a Model B of most generations.</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi is a very cheap computer that runs Linux, but it also provides a set of GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins that allow you to control electronic components for physical computing and explore the Internet of Things (IoT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-raspberry-pi-models-have-been-released&#34;&gt;What Raspberry Pi models have been released?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been three generations of Raspberry Pis: Pi 1, Pi 2, and Pi 3, and there has generally been a Model A and a Model B of most generations. Model A is a cheaper variant and tends to have reduced RAM and ports like USB and Ethernet. The Pi Zero is a spinoff of the original (Pi 1) generation, made even smaller and cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-can-you-do-with-a-raspberry-pi&#34;&gt;What can you do with a Raspberry Pi?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people buy a Raspberry Pi to learn to code, and people who can already code use the Pi to learn to code electronics for physical projects. The Raspberry Pi can open opportunities for you to create your own home automation projects, which is popular among people in the open source community because it puts you in control, rather than using a proprietary closed system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>What is cybersecurity? Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.
Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.

The digital ledger allows for the secure sharing of information and identity authentication, without the typical risks of exposing data to outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud Technology
e diverse array of data that can be stored on a single cloud account is staggering but this also exposes users to obvious security flaws. Fortunately, cloud security has made leaps and bounds in recent years, with developers ensuring that all data is much better protected against hacks than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IoT Security
One of the major flaws with early-release Internet of Things technology is that it connected multiple devices without a common security apparatus.
Nowadays it is common for IoT software to have a cybersecurity infrastructure that can be shared with all devices within a household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <content>&lt;p&gt;An internet based on quantum physics will soon enable inherently secure communication. A team at Delft University of Technology, is building a network connecting four cities in the Netherlands entirely by means of quantum technology. Messages sent over this network will be unhackable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Delft network, will be the first to transmit information between cities using quantum techniques from end to end. The technology relies on a quantum behavior of atomic particles called entanglement. Entangled photons can’t be covertly read without disrupting their content. But entangled particles are difficult to create, and harder still to transmit over long distances. This technology has demonstrated it can send more than 1.5 kilometers, and they are confident they can set up a quantum link between Delft and the Hague by around the end of this year. Ensuring an unbroken connection over greater distances will require quantum repeaters that extend the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such repeaters are currently in design at Delft and elsewhere. The first should be completed in the next five to six years with a global quantum network following by the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A smart material is an object that holds a property that is susceptible to change with the introduction of an external stimulus. This change must be either tangible or visible for the material to qualify for ‘smart’ status. These changes can include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electrical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chemical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thermal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magnetic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of smart materials has been expanded recently to include any materials that may not display a physical change,  but do hold electronic functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Material scientists and smart materials
Common examples of products that hold intelligent materials include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mood rings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responsive glasses that darken when in direct sunlight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colour-changing mugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these may not be considered particularly groundbreaking, material scientists are continuing their studies to ascertain potential applications of other materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-are-the-problems-with-smart-materials&#34;&gt;What are the problems with smart materials?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the applications of smart materials (both current and futuristic) are far-reaching, some drawbacks are preventing a heavier reliance on them, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delicacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diminished performance over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporation difficulties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toxicity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Future applications of smart materials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;aerial-industry&#34;&gt;Aerial industry&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application of smart materials will enable the wings of aircraft to be more flexible thanks to shape-memory alloys. The outer elements of an aircraft will become more skin-like in that they will have to be strong, hard and rigid, yet flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory behind this design stems from Da Vinci’s flying machine, an example of a historic smart material theory being realised with tomorrow’s modern technology. The ‘skin’ of the plane will also have self-healing properties, even when the aircraft is in flight; thanks to the introduction of self-healing plastics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;energy-sector&#34;&gt;Energy Sector&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation of printed photovoltaic cells will allow the energy sector to take solar panels to the next level. Photovoltaic cells can be painted onto any surface, in any shape. These cells can transform sunlight and heat into electricity. This will undoubtedly have a positive impact on residential properties and, while this solution is not yet commercially-ready, the industry is certainly getting closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mobile-industry&#34;&gt;Mobile industry&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are LG devices that already contain self-healing materials, restoring any scratches that occur on the back of the device. However, research is currently taking place to move this on to another level. The aim is to invent self-healing glass (for screens) and lithium batteries that can be housed within mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;automotive-industry&#34;&gt;Automotive industry&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windscreen chips become cracked due to water molecules within the air mixing with the chip in the glass, breaking it down and worsening the condition. Crack-resistant glass is currently in development that reacts well with airborne water molecules, resulting in the glass healing over time instead of deteriorating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As material scientists continue to study intelligent materials, further future applications will be discovered. The opportunity within the energy, automotive, medical and even military sectors are sure to benefit from the technological advances available through the incorporation of smart materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CNC are manufacturing machines that run on numeric controlled programs to manufacture parts of high precision for the industry. The CNC uses different software&amp;rsquo;s to control all of the machines motions as the spindle speed and the axes movements. This machines uses a special language called “G-Code”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the CNC Machines the manufacture parts were done manually by machinists, they were less precise and took a lot more time than tne CNC the be done. With this machining tools the industry  got an increase in their productivity thanks to the capacity of the mchine to run automatically without the constant attention of an operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;cnc-milling-machines&#34;&gt;CNC Milling Machines&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a mill, the cutter is placed in the spindle where it rotates. The workpiece then moves past the cutter so that chips may be sliced off. The act of cutting a workpiece on a mill is called “Milling”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNC Mills have at the very least the ability to cut in 3 dimensions which are referred to as the X, Y, and Z axes.  Each axis is controlled by a servo or stepper motor that is triggered by the CNC Control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;cnc-lathes&#34;&gt;CNC Lathes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some view Lathes as the only universal CNC Machine because a lathe can make all of the parts needed for another lathe. A lathe spins the workpiece in a spindle while a fixed cutting tool approaches the workpiece to slice chips off of it. Because of this geometry, lathes are ideal for parts that have symmetry around some axis that could be chucked up in the spindle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNC Lathes have at the very least the ability to drive the cutting tool under g-code control over 2 axes, referred to as X and Z. They may have a considerable amount of other functionality as well, and there are many variations on lathes such as Swiss Lathes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jF4F8Zr2YO8?autoplay=1&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;cnc-routers&#34;&gt;CNC Routers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CNC Router is actually a type of CNC Mill, typically one that uses what’s called a “gantry” configuration. They’re called CNC Routers instead of CNC Gantry Mills when they’re used to cut wood, but this need not exclusively be the case.  A typical CNC Router is usually not capable of as much precision as a CNC Mill.  They sacrifice some precision in the name of a larger work envelope with the gantry design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many think of CNC machines as being focused on cutting metal, but there is a huge market for CNC woodworking machines of which the CNC Router is the principle example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;cnc-plasma-cutters-lasers-and-waterjets&#34;&gt;CNC Plasma Cutters, Lasers, and Waterjets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNC Plasma Cutters, Lasers, and Waterjets are different kinds of CNC Machines that are used primarily to cut parts out of flat sheet material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;even-more-cnc-machines&#34;&gt;Even More CNC Machines&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of CNC Machines is extensive.  Here are some of the other possibilities we haven’t mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Electronic Discharge Machines (“EDM’s”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Foam Cutters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Wire Bending and Tubing Bending Machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Punches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Embroidery Machines (they put custom logos on Baseball caps!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Pattern Cutters (for cutting vinyl, paper, and more in precise patterns)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Food Makers (for cake decoration and more)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNC Pottery Printers (a form of 3D Printer)&lt;/li&gt;

      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-does-it-work&#34;&gt;how does it work?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a combat between two remote controlled robots until one is incapacitated. This competitions are televised the most famous ones are robot wars in the UK and BattleBots in the US, they were televised for a short period of time in the 1990 and 2000, with a little hype in the 2010. There are smaller robot combat events that are staged for live audiences such as those organized by the Robot Fighting League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robot builders are generally hobbyists and the complexity and cost of their machines can vary substantially. Robot combat uses weight classes, with the heaviest robots able to exert more power and destructive capabilities. The rules of competitions are designed for the safety of the builders, operators, and spectators while also providing for an entertaining spectacle. Robot combat arenas are generally surrounded by a bulletproof screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competitor robots come in a variety of designs, with different strategies for winning fights. Robot designs typically incorporate weapons for attacking opponents, such as axes, hammers, flippers and spinning devices. Rules almost always prohibit gun-like weapons as well as other strategies not conducive to the safety and enjoyment of participants and spectators.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;https://stepzep.com/img/battleweights.png&#34;  class=&#34;left&#34;  /&gt;


&lt;h1 id=&#34;safety-precautions&#34;&gt;Safety precautions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the violent nature of robot fighting, safety is always the most important issue at robot events. Robot fights take place in a sturdy arena, usually constructed of steel, wood, and bulletproof clear Lexan plastic. The smaller, lighter classes compete in smaller arenas than the heavyweights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition rules set limits on construction features that are too dangerous or which could lead to uninteresting contests. Strict limits are placed on materials and pressures used in pneumatic or hydraulic actuators, and fail-safe systems are required for electronic control circuits. Generally off-limits for use as weapons are nets, liquids, deliberate radio jamming, high-voltage electric discharge, untethered projectiles, and usually fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;robot-fighting-associations&#34;&gt;Robot fighting associations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sport has no overall governing body, though some regional associations oversee several events in managerial or advisory capacities with published rulesets. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robot Fighting League (RFL), primarily U.S., operated 2002—2012
Fighting Robot Association (FRA), U.K., 2003–
Standardised Procedures for the Advancement of Robot Combat (SPARC), U.S., 2015–[10]
The major televised competitions have operated outside of these associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;prohibited-weaponry&#34;&gt;Prohibited weaponry&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the first robot combat competitions, some types of weapons have been prohibited either because they violated the spirit of the competition or they could not be safely used. Prohibited weapons have generally included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radio jamming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High voltage electric discharge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquids (glue, oil, water, corrosives&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire (except in BattleBots)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explosives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Un-tethered projectiles (except in BattleBots from 2018 season onwards)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entanglement devices (except in Robot Wars from series 10 onwards)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lasers above 1 milliwatt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual obstruction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Halon – a specific fire extinguishing gas effective as a weapon in stopping internal combustion engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>The idea of a robot or android or whatever technological being doing chores for human beings had always been there, in every futuristic movie or carton there is a bot that its main job is to make menial chores. Nowadays it is a reality, it began with little machines that swept and mopped the floor but know it had evolved into whole places that run without human interaction. Shops and fast-food restaurants that ad no longer human employees but robots that manage to do the same work more efficiently, precise, and quick, here are three examples of this places:</description>

&lt;p&gt;Handle is a mobile manipulation robot designed for logistics. Handle autonomously performs mixed SKU pallet building and depalletizing after initialization and localizing against the pallets. The on-board vision system on Handle tracks the marked pallets for navigation and finds individual boxes for grasping and placing.
When Handle places a boxes onto a pallet, it uses force control to nestle each box up against its neighbors.  The boxes used in the video weigh about 5 Kg (11 lbs), but the robot is designed to handle boxes up to (15 Kg) (33 lb).  This version of Handle works with pallets that are 1.2 m deep and 1.7 m tall (48 inches deep and 68 inches tall).&lt;/p&gt;
